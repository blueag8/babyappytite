This application would allow users \nto share and access recipes for children to help the through the weaning* process. \n\n*Weaning is the process of gradually introducing an infant to an adult diet while gradually withdrawing the supply of 'Infant' milk.\n\nBecause it is very important that a child is weaned in stages, usally by months at \na time, the recipes are grouped by stages.\n\n\n##UX\n\n##External User\n\nAs a user I want to explore different ideas for recipes to feed my baby. I want to \nknow if they are tried or liked by others, as I prefer to try first, recipes that \nseem to be enjoyed. \n\nI wish to be able to share/exchange recipes with others. \nAs my child needs to be introduced to foods in stages I want to refer to recipes \nthat are relative to the developmental stage my child is at. \n\nI want a site that is visually appealing and easy to use.\n\n##Site Owners Future Prospects\n\nThe possibilty to provide users with the ability to get an ingredients list\nto build a shopping list and to add items to a shopping cart. \n\nReports could be made to provide feedback on the age specific recipes being favourited,\nadvertising can also be customized to target 'age' specific audiences.\n\nLogin/registration features will provide the site owner with a customer database \nwhich in future can be used to build and maintain customer relationships. \n\n\n##The Schema used for storing this data in MongoDB is as follows:\n\nThe database \"Baby_Recipes\", contains two collections: \"Categories\" and \"Recipes\".\nBoth of these collections contain a Key \"category_age\" with corresponding values\nie. \"category_age\": \"6 months +\"\n\nPlease see following images for wireframe and schema's:\n\n![alt wireframe](wireframeforbabyappytite.jpg \"mockup\")\n\n![alt wireframe](recipes_ list_ by_ age.jpg)\n\n![alt wireframe](schema_categories.png \"recipes\")\n\n![alt wireframe](schema_recipe.png \"categories\")\n\n\nTo insert recipes in bulk I used notepad see \"recipes.txt\"[here]\nthis was copied and pasted into the AWS CLI \n\nCommenced development of the application using both frameworks \"Materialize\" and \"Bootsrap\", tutor suggested the frameworks may try \nto compete with each other. Removed Bootstrap which affected any CSS editing I had previously done.\n\n\n\nIssues\n\nTesting \n\n\n\nUX design improvements required\n\nYellow used for \"7 months +\" is quite harsh on the users eye. An alternative colour will be \nmore visually pleasing.\n\nFuture implementations-Registered login/user identity\n-ability to only edit or delete 'user' owned entries\n-Image upload\n-Social media links\n-Search bar\n-Allergen filter \n-Shopping list\n\n-Commenting ability\n-Sorting new recipes at the top\n\n\nUsability and Visual Impact:\nProject Purpose\nUX design\nSuitability for purpose\nNavigation\nEase of use\nInformation Architecture\nDefensive Design\nLayout and Visual Impact:\nResponsive Design\nImage Presentation\nColour scheme and typography\n\n\nBugs\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nto test app in development set configuration as follows:\n\nrequirements.txt [here]\n\nHeroku vars\n\nPort 0.0.0.0\nIP 8080\nMONGO URI \"mongodb+srv://blueag8:******@cluster0-iodau.mongodb.net/Baby_Recipes?retryWrites=true&w=majority\"\n\nDyno formation = web : Python \n\n \nFor deployment:\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(host=os.environ.get('IP'),\n            port=int(os.environ.get('PORT')),\n            debug=False)\n\nfor testing set debug to True. \n\n\n\n\n\nDeployment\nFeatures\nIn this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.\n\nExisting Features\nFeature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z\n...\nFor some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.\n\nIn addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:\n\n\nDeployment\nThis section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).\n\nIn particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:\n\nDifferent values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?\nDifferent configuration files?\nSeparate git branch?\nIn addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Credits\n\n###Aknowledgements:\n\nMentor Antonio Rodriguez\n\nCode Institute Tutors:\nMichael Park\nNiel McEwan\nSlack Channel #Data-Centric-Dev:\nFellow student's questions on Slack and referred to projects including\nDave O'dea's \"FlaskBook\" Recipe App \nhttps://github.com/davedodea/FlaskBook\nDeirdre Welden's \"DumpDinners\" Recipe App\nhttps://github.com/Deirdre18/dumpdinners-recipe-app\n\n###jQuery-borrowed and adjusted code to add a functioning button to add and delete recipe ingredients and steps so that\nthe could be submited as array items, and returned as list items. \n\nPlease see:\n\nhttps://www.sanwebe.com/2013/03/addremove-input-fields-dynamically-with-jquery\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/14853779/adding-input-elements-dynamically-to-form\n\n###Images used from \nhttps://www.seekclipart.com/clipart/\nCategory-age and image links edited and or produced by myself using paint.\n\nRecipes borrowed for the purpose of development from \n\nhttps://www.annabelkarmel.com/\nsee Ebook in \"documents and wireframe\" [here] \n\n\nUtilized following documentation, turorials and code checking sites:\nhttps://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/\nhttps://jshint.com/\nhttps://www.w3schools.com\nhttps://www.10bestdesign.com/dirtymarkup/\n\n\n\n\n\n","undoManager":{"mark":-1217,"position":100,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":70,"column":24},"end":{"row":70,"column":25},"action":"insert","lines":["c"],"id":2038}],[{"start":{"row":72,"column":17},"end":{"row":72,"column":18},"action":"remove","lines":["S"],"id":2039}],[{"start":{"row":72,"column":17},"end":{"row":72,"column":18},"action":"insert","lines":["s"],"id":2040}],[{"start":{"row":72,"column":24},"end":{"row":72,"column":25},"action":"remove","lines":["R"],"id":2041}],[{"start":{"row":72,"column":24},"end":{"row":72,"column":25},"action":"insert","lines":["r"],"id":2042}],[{"start":{"row":175,"column":0},"end":{"row":181,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.","","In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:","","As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.","This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
